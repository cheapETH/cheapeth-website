Think about it. A transaction that costs $77 on ETH, is only $0.08 on cheapETH. Made possible by cheapgas.<br />
The cheap eth gang solves the gas crisis.<br />
* Imagine a 100% compatible car with your car that's 1000x cheaper. Or even a cup of coffee. You'll be living like a king in no time.<br />

<h3>How to get cheapETH</h3>
<p>
If you had ETH in block 11818959, you have cheapETH! A 1 to 1 ratio of course.<br />
You'll also be able to buy cheapETH in the crowd sale, 1 ETH for 1000 cheapETH.<br />
Breakdown:
</p>
<ul>
<li>80% to existing ETH holders</li>
<li>10% in cheapETH crowdsale</li>
<li>10% held to fund maintaining and upgrading cheapETH and pay our developers</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can also mine cheapETH, just like normal eth. Except it's easier, because it's cheap.
</p>

<h3>CheapETH market cap</h3>
<p>
If ethereum has a market cap of $186 billion, cheapETH has a market cap of $186 million.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Why cheapETH?</h3>
<p>
So aside from the fact that ETH is too expensive for normal people to use, cheapETH can serve many purposes.<br />
<br />
Testnets suffer from this problem of valueless currency. You don't want valueless, since DDOS is free. Cheap is better than free.<br />
Testnets also lack a rich ecosystem of contracts. cheapETH also has cheapSNX, cheapDAI, and even cheapBAT. All is cheap on cheapETH.<br /><br/>

You test in prod on cheapETH.<br/>
You can be a little guy on cheapETH. This is not a whalechain, unlike other eths<br/>
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Wait, how much is a cheapDAI worth?</h3>
<p>
That's a great question. I see an argument for a tenth of a cent, and I also see an argument for $1.00. The market can decide!
