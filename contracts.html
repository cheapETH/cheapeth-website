<h3>CheapCrasher</h3>
https://cheapcrasher.com/ 

The way it works is:
1. you click on play
2. you fill out and submit the form
3. you send a transaction between 0.1 and 1 CTH to the game wallet
4. you wait for the payment to get approved and show up on the website.
5. if you win the game will send the transaction * multiplier back to you instantly

important: don’t send transactions without the form being successfully submitted or the transaction will get lost. also please don’t send above 5CTH. those payments will get ignored because I wouldn’t be able to pay the winner haha. (jackpot is only 30 cth rn)
